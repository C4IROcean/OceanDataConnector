# Ocean Data Platform Workspaces

Welcome to Workspaces! A JupyterHub environment where you can directly access the ODP Catalog  and datasets using our API. Packages for pulling data and analyzing data are already installed, so no need to spend time setting up the environment!

Please find relevant notebooks to get you started and don't forget to check out our [documentation](https://docs.hubocean.earth/)
