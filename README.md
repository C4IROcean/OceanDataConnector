# Ocean Data Platform Workspaces

Welcome to Workspaces! A JupyterHub environment where you can directly access the ODP Catalog  and datasets using our API. Packages for pulling data and analyzing data are already installed, so no need to spend time setting up the environment!

Please find relevant notebooks to get you started and don't forget to check out our [documentation](https://docs.hubocean.earth/)

## Example Notebooks
We provide a number of example notebooks to get you going with Ocean Data Platform and are always adding new ones as we deploy new features. These are contained in two folders.

#### Dataset Examples
- Pull data from the ODP APIs from various datasets: EMODnetHumanActivities_access_data.ipynb, SeamountsDatabase_access_data.ipynb
- Query data with geospatial tools with the ODP APIs: PGS_CTDBiotaADCP_access_data.ipynb
- Combine data from ODP with external data: PGS_OBIS_combination.ipynb

#### Workflow Examples
- Upload raw data files into ODP: raw_file_upload.ipynb
- Upload a tabular data example to ODP: tabular-data-upload-ILIAD-example

Note: this Ocean Data Platform Tutorials directory will be automatically synced with new updates and new notebooks when added to the [github repo](https://github.com/C4IROcean/OceanDataConnector). Therefore we recommend that best practice is:
- use a separate directory for your personal notebooks and work, and,
- if you want to use or edit the examples, create a duplicate first and work on that version, then the original files will stay up to date.
