# Ocean Data Platform Workspaces

Welcome to Workspaces! A JupyterHub environment where you can directly access the ODP Catalog  and datasets using our API. Packages for pulling data and analyzing data are already installed, so no need to spend time setting up the environment!

Please find relevant notebooks to get you started and don't forget to check out our [documentation](https://docs.hubocean.earth/)

## Example Notebooks
We provide a number of example notebooks to get you going with Ocean Data Platform and are always adding new ones as we deploy new features. An overview of the notebooks we have are:

- Pull data from the ODP APIs: ODP_data_pull.ipynb
- Query data with geospatial tools withthe ODP API: PGS_geospatial_querying.ipynb
- Combine data from ODP with external data: PGS_OBIS-usecase-simple.ipynb
- Uplaod raw data into ODP: raw_file_upload.ipynb
