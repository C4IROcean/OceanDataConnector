# Global Vessel Emissions

## Overview

Ship position data and vessel information have been used to estimate the global vessel emissions according to the ICCT methodology, which is used in the IMO GHG studies. The global vessel emissions and traffic dataset is gridded in space and time, showing CO2 emissions and traffic density (hours) for different vessel categories on a monthly basis beginning from January 2020.
