# General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO)

## Overview

The General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) is a publicly available bathymetric chart of the world's oceans. 
The project was conceived with the aim of preparing a global series of charts showing the general shape of the seafloor. 
Over the years it has become a reference map of the bathymetry of the worldâ€™s oceans for scientists and others.
