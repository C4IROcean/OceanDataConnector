# ProtectedSeas

## Overview
Navigator catalogs boundary and regulation information for areas in maritime waters that manage extraction of natural living resources (i.e. fishing and take). For mariners and ocean users, these data allow for real-time access to place-based regulation information and details on the variety of prohibitions and restrictions that apply throughout the ocean. For the conservation community, these data provide an important resource for understanding both the where and how of current ocean protections - to inform progress and plans for reaching goals like 30x30.

The geometry column in ProtectedSeas can be used as input for querying other datasets.
